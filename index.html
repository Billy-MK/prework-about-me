      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a recent graduate from UCSB with a degree in Biopsychology. I'm enrolled in the UC Davis Coding Boot camp to learn how to become a web developer.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Davis, CA</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Climbing, board games, reading, gaming.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I don't really have a specific "dream job", although anything that allows for flexibility, security, and an opportunity to be creative sounds great to me.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Santa Barbara, CA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have always been interested in computers and coding, but didn't have a real opportunity to pursue that interest as an undergradute. Now that I've graduated, I am enrolling in the UCD Boot Camp to learn more about web development. I hope that my experience in Biopsychology will allow me to provide a unique perspective to the field, and I'm excited to meet my fellow students from similarly unique backgrounds.</p>
